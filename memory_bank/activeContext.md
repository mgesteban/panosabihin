# Active Context: AiPolyglot Translation App

## Current Work Focus
The AiPolyglot translation application has been enhanced with user authentication and payment functionality. Users must now sign up/login before using the app and are limited to 5 free translations before being prompted to upgrade for unlimited access.

## Recent Changes
- **Authentication System**: Implemented Supabase authentication with email/password signup/login
- **User Management**: Added user profiles with translation count tracking and payment status
- **Usage Tracking**: Users are limited to 5 free translations before upgrade required
- **Payment Integration**: Added upgrade prompt with $5 one-time payment for unlimited access
- **Session Management**: Automatic session handling with logout functionality
- **Memory Bank**: Comprehensive documentation created for project context and patterns

## Current Status

### Working Features
1. **Text Translation**: Users can input text in any language and receive English translations
2. **Voice Input**: Speech-to-text functionality with automatic translation trigger
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management with user-friendly messages
4. **Responsive UI**: Mobile-first design with clean, accessible interface
5. **API Integration**: Functional OpenAI API integration through Next.js API routes

### Active Components
- `TranslationApp`: Main application component managing state and user interactions
- `VoiceInput`: Voice recognition component with browser compatibility checks
- `translation-service`: Client-side service for API communication
- `/api/translate`: Server-side API route handling OpenAI integration

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Testing & Validation**: Verify all functionality works across different browsers and devices
2. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor and optimize translation response times
3. **Error Scenarios**: Test edge cases and error handling paths
4. **Documentation**: Complete technical documentation for deployment

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Language Detection**: Add visual feedback showing detected input language
2. **Translation History**: Optional feature to save recent translations
3. **Audio Output**: Text-to-speech for translated results
4. **Batch Translation**: Support for multiple text inputs
5. **API Key Management**: In-app API key configuration interface

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions
- **Single Language Output**: Focused on English-only translation for simplicity
- **GPT-3.5-turbo**: Chosen for balance of quality and cost-effectiveness
- **Client-Server Architecture**: API routes protect OpenAI key while enabling client-side interactions
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Voice input gracefully degrades when not supported

### User Experience Decisions
- **Auto-translation**: Voice input automatically triggers translation for seamless experience
- **Minimal Interface**: Single-purpose design reduces cognitive load
- **Mobile-first**: Prioritizes mobile experience for on-the-go usage
- **Error Transparency**: Clear error messages help users understand and resolve issues

### Current Constraints
- **OpenAI Dependency**: Application requires valid OpenAI API key to function
- **Browser Limitations**: Voice input limited to browsers supporting Web Speech API
- **Network Dependency**: Requires internet connection for all translation operations
- **English-only Output**: Current scope limited to English translations

## Development Environment
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Radix UI components
- **Development Server**: `npm run dev` on localhost:3000
- **Build Process**: Standard Next.js build pipeline
- **Dependencies**: All required packages installed via npm/pnpm

## Known Issues
- Voice input may not work in all browsers (graceful degradation implemented)
- API key must be configured in environment variables for production use
- Translation quality depends on OpenAI service availability and performance

## Monitoring Points
- Translation accuracy and response times
- Voice recognition success rates across browsers
- Error rates and user feedback
- Mobile device compatibility and performance
