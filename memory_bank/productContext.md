# Product Context: AiPolyglot Translation App

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
In our increasingly connected world, language barriers remain a significant obstacle to communication. People frequently encounter text in languages they don't understand - whether in documents, messages, websites, or spoken conversations. Existing translation tools often require multiple steps, complex interfaces, or lack voice input capabilities.

### Solution Vision
AiPolyglot provides an instant, accessible translation solution that removes friction from the translation process. By combining text and voice input with AI-powered translation, users can quickly understand content in any language without leaving their workflow.

## How It Should Work

### User Journey
1. **Input**: User either types text or speaks in any language
2. **Processing**: Application detects the input and sends it to OpenAI for translation
3. **Output**: Clean, natural English translation appears immediately
4. **Feedback**: Clear error messages if something goes wrong

### Key User Interactions
- **Voice Input**: Click microphone button, speak naturally, automatic translation
- **Text Input**: Type or paste text, click translate button
- **Results**: View translation in clean, readable format
- **Error Recovery**: Clear feedback when API key missing or translation fails

### User Experience Goals

#### Simplicity
- Single-purpose interface focused solely on translation
- Minimal cognitive load - no complex settings or options
- One-click voice input activation

#### Speed
- Immediate feedback on user actions
- Fast translation responses (target < 3 seconds)
- Auto-translation after voice input completes

#### Reliability
- Graceful handling of network issues
- Clear error messages with actionable guidance
- Fallback options when voice input unavailable

#### Accessibility
- Voice input for hands-free operation
- Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go use
- Clear visual feedback for all states (loading, error, success)
