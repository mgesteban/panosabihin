# Product Context: AiPolyglot Translation App

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
In our increasingly connected world, language barriers remain a significant obstacle to communication. People frequently encounter text in languages they don't understand - whether in documents, messages, websites, or spoken conversations. Existing translation tools often require multiple steps, complex interfaces, or lack voice input capabilities, especially for languages like Tagalog/Filipino which have limited support in mainstream tools.

### Solution Vision
AiPolyglot provides an instant, accessible translation solution that removes friction from the translation process. By combining advanced voice recognition (optimized for Tagalog), text input, and AI-powered translation with user authentication and subscription management, users can quickly understand content in any language without leaving their workflow. The app offers a generous 100-translation free trial before requiring a subscription.
